## RecolagEval Bot
This bot loads pre-defined [GOLMI](https://github.com/clp-research/golmi) boards and show them to the user who is
asked to describe the target piece. 

## Setting up and running

### Setup 

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You might also need the [jq package](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) too. 
2. Clone the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) repository.
3. Before running the bot, several environmental variables would need to be generated and assigned. This process is detailed in the [documentation](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html), which details both the general preparation and the [bot specific initialisations](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html#chatting-with-a-bot). The bot also needs to have specific permissions, listed below this paragraph. The above permissions can be found in [this example permissions file](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots/blob/golmi/recolageval/data/bot_permissions.json) already.  
    ```
    {
        "api": true,
        "send_html_message": true,
        "send_privately": true,
        "send_command": true,
        "send_image": true
    }
    ```
4. Make sure that the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) and slurk-bots repositories live next to each other on the same level.
5. Copy the content of the [```plugins```] directory to [```slurk/slurk/views/static/plugins```](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk/tree/master/slurk/views/static/plugins).
6. Navigate to the base directory of the slurk-bots repository and run the script to launch this bot, your command should look like this:  
 ```$ python start_bot.py recolageval/ --users 1 --extra-args recolageval/args.ini --copy-plugins --dev```.  
 This script will build and run the docker images, it will initialise all the env variables with the right permissions and it will set everything up for testing locally on your computer. The bot will appear in your containers list as ```slurk/recolageval```.

### Running and playing the bot
A [GOLMI server](https://github.com/clp-research/golmi) is needed to run this bot. Make sure that golmi is on the `slurk` branch.

If you have everything already set up, you can run the bot using the following command (take notice of the right env variable names):    
```bash
docker run \
    --net="host" \
    -e BOT_TOKEN=$THIS_BOT_TOKEN \
    -e BOT_ID=$THIS_BOT \
    -e TASK_ID=$TASK_ID \
    -e WAITING_ROOM=$WAITING_ROOM \
    -e SLURK_PORT=5000 \
    -e GOLMI_SERVER=$GOLMI_SERVER \
    -e GOLMI_PASSWORD=$GOLMI_PASSWORD \
    -d slurk/recolageval-bot
```
