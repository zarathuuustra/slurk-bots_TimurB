Together with your partner, guess the secret 5-letter word. The image gives you a hint, but the connection may be indirect.
You must submit the same guess as your partner, so coordinate! If the guess is not correct, you get more hints: 
Green means that the letter is in the right position.
Yellow means that the letter is in the wrong position.
Grey means that the word does not contain this letter.
The earlier you guess the word, the more points you get, so put your heads together!
